- We built the ghosts and the special candy players using BFS algorithm inorder to best find the path they should go.
- On Part 2 of the assignment we had to pick out of a list, 2 functionalities that we added:
  1) We added a unique candy that pops randomly on the screen, on random sports and dissapear after a certain time, the candy keep doing it while the game is running. the candy gives the player more points than the normal candies. (50 points)
  2) We added spcial pills , that gives the player more lives in the game.
